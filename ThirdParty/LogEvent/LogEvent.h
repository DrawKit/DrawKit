//
//    The LogEvent files contain functions (most notably LogEvent()) useful for
// *conditionally* logging various types of events or steps with in a process. The intent
// is for an application to allow an end user to enable (or "turn on") various types of
// logging (or permanent debugging). The logging of messages for any given type is
// prevented unless its type has been turned on (i.e., a user pref has been set).
//    For you to use the LogEvent functionality, qUseLogEvent must be defined (typically
// in a precompiled header). If you want event logging to drop out of one of your
// configurations (or you do not agree to the licensing terms), don't define qUseLogEvent.
// (For more about dropping event logging out of one of your configurations, see the
// Macros section below.)
// 
//    The LoggingController class encapsulates an NSWindowController for modifying the
// user selectable logging options. It follows the singleton design pattern and therefore
// follows Apple's guidelines for a singleton (cf. "Creating a Singleton Instance" chapter
// in the Cocoa Fundamentals Guide).
// 
//    Although frameworks may use LogEvent() and the various event types defined below,
// they generally do not actually make use of the LoggingController class (and its nib
// file). The LoggingController class is a UI level object that simplifies turning logging
// on or off. Adding it to your application is easy.
//    In our projects, we typically have access to the Logging dialog "hidden" in the
// -showAboutBox: IBAction. In other words, to enable or disable logging, a user simply
// holds down a modifier key while choosing About Application. It looks something like
// this:

/*- (IBAction)showAboutBox:(id)sender
{
	BOOL isOptionKeyDown = (([[NSApp currentEvent] modifierFlags] & NSAlternateKeyMask) != 0);
	if (isOptionKeyDown)
	{
		[[LoggingController sharedLoggingController] showLoggingWindow];
	}else
	{
		[[AboutBox sharedAboutBox] showAboutBox:sender];
	}
}*/

extern NSString* const kKVOEvent;		//!< pertains to KVO adding or removing observers, which events lead to a very verbose log if enabled, therefore separate.

//    Remember, you are not required to use all of the event types. They are intended
// solely to make it easier to reduce the noise level in any given set of logged output.


#pragma mark Macros (when qUseLogEvent defined)
//    When qUseLogEvent is defined, you can use all of the LogEvent features. However,
// when it is not defined, only the LogEvent_ macro remains available, but it is defined
// to do nothing. This macro makes it easy to drop event logging out of one of your
// configurations. It simply converts to a LogEvent() call when qUseLogEvent is defined,
// or does nothing when it is not.

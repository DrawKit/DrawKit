/** @brief These category methods perform high-level text layout.

These category methods perform high-level text layout.

In the first case, the text is laid out in the layoutRect which dictates the line wrapping and number lines by its width or height (this rect
is the text container in other words). The resulting text is then rotated to the given angle and mapped into <destRect>, which applies any visual scaling
and translation, and drawn into the current context.

The second method is similar except that text is flowed into the layoutPath.

 @param layoutSize a size describing the text layout container. Text is laid out to fit into this size.

 Luminosity of a colour is both subjective and dependent on the display characteristics of particular
 monitors, etc. A frequently used formula can be traced to experiments done by the NTSC television
 standards committee in 1953, which was based on tube phosphors in common use at that time. A more
 modern formula is applicable for LCD monitors. This method uses the NTSC formula if
 NTSC_1953_STANDARD is defined, otherwise the modern one.

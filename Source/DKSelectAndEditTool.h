/**
This tool implements the standard selection and edit tool behaviour (multi-purpose tool) which allows objects to be selected,
moved by dragging and to be edited by having their knobs dragged. For editing, objects mostly handle this themselves, but this
provides the initial translation of mouse events into edit operations.

Note that the tool can only be used in layers which are DKObjectDrawingLayers - if the layer is not of this kind then the
tool mode is set to invalid and nothing is done.

The 'marquee' (selection rect) is drawn using a style, giving great flexibility as to its appearance. In general a style that
has a very low opacity should be used - the default style takes the system's highlight colour and makes a low opacity version of it.

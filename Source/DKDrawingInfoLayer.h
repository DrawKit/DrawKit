/** @brief This is a DKLayer subclass which is able to draw an information panel in a corner of the drawing.

This is a DKLayer subclass which is able to draw an information panel in a corner of the drawing.

The info panel takes data from DKDrawing's metadata dictionary ind displays some of it - standard
keys such as the drawing number, name of the draughtsman, creation and modification dates and so on.

This can also directly edit the same information.

This is not a very important class within DK, and mays apps will not want to use it, or to use it in
modified form. It is provided as another example of how to implement layer subclasses as much as anything.

 lineheight) and then rects forming from the resulting points. See -lineFragmentRectsForFixedLineheight:

 computationally intensive, so the result should probably be cached until the shape is actually changed.
 This works with a fixed lineheight, where every line is the same. Note that this method isn't really

 Similar to object placement, but treats the objects as "links" like in a chain, where a rigid link
 of a fixed length connects two points on the path. The factory object is called with the pair of
 points computed, and returns a path representing the link between those two points. Non-nil results are
 accumulated into the array returned. Even and odd links can have different lengths for added
 flexibility. Note that to keep this working quickly, the link length is used as a path length to
 find the initial link pivot point, then the actual point is calculated by using the link radius
 in this direction. The result can be that links will not exactly follow a very convoluted or
 curved path, but each link is guaranteed to be a fixed length and exactly join to its neighbours.
 In practice, this gives results that are very "physical" in that it emulates the behaviour of
 real chains that are bent through acute angles.

/** @brief DKHandle is a base class for all handles, which are the knobs attached to shapes for interacting with them.

DKHandle is a base class for all handles, which are the knobs attached to shapes for interacting with them. This is an evolution of DKKnob
 which is still used as a central helper class for dispatching drawing to handles as needed.
 
 DKHandle is subclassed for each handle type, making it easier to customise and also add caching.

/** @brief This is a group objects that can group any number of shapes or paths.

This is a group objects that can group any number of shapes or paths.

It inherits from DKDrawableShape so that it gets the usual sizing and rotation behaviours.

This operates by establishing its own coordinate system in which the objects are embedded. An informal protocol is used that allows a shape or
path to obtain the transform of its "parent". When that parent is a group, the transform is manipulated such that the path is modified just
prior to rendering to allow for the group's size, rotation, etc.

Be aware of one "gotcha" with this class - a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. When objects are grouped, they are offset to be local to the group's
overall location. For grouping to be undoable, the objects being grouped need to have a valid container at the time this location offset is done,
so that there is an undo manager available to record that change. If not they might end up in the wrong place when undoing the "group" command.

For the normal case of grouping existing objects within a layer, this is not an issue, but can be if you are programmatically creating groups.

/** @brief DKDrawingTool is the semi-abstract base class for all types of drawing tool.

DKDrawingTool is the semi-abstract base class for all types of drawing tool. The point of a tool is to act as a translator for basic mouse events and
convert those events into meaningful operations on the target layer or object(s). One tool can be set at a time (see DKToolController) and
establishes a "mode" of operation for handling mouse events.

The tool also supplies a cursor for the view when that tool is selected.

A tool typically targets a layer or the objects within it. The calling sequence to a tool is coordinated by the DKToolController, targeting
the current active layer. Tools can change the data content of the layer or not - for example a zoom zool would only change the scale of
a view, not change any data.

Tools should be considered to be controllers, and sit between the view and the drawing data model.

Note: do not confuse "tools" as DK defines them with a palette of buttons or other UI - an application might implement an interface to
select a tool in such a way, but the buttons are not tools. A button could store a tool as its representedObject however. These UI con-
siderations are outside the scope of DK itself.

/** @brief This is a very general-purpose view class that provides some handy high-level methods for doing zooming.

 This is a very general-purpose view class that provides some handy high-level methods for doing zooming. Simply hook up
 the action methods to suitable menu commands and away you go. The stuff you draw within drawRect: doesn't need to know or
 care abut the zoom of the view - you can just draw as usual and it works.

 @note
 this class doesn't bother to support NSCoding and thereby encoding the view zoom, because it usually isn't important for this
 value to persist. However, if your subclass wants to support coding, your initWithCoder method should reset _scale to 1.0. Otherwise
 it will get initialized to 0.0 and NOTHING WILL BE DRAWN.

 retriggered by further events. If it times out, this resets to NO. It can be used as one part of a
 drawing strategy where rapid changes temporarily use a lower quality drawing mechanism for performance,
 but reverts to a higher quality when things settle.

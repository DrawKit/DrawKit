/** @brief This layer adds the concept of selection to drawable objects as defined by DKObjectOwnerLayer.

 This layer adds the concept of selection to drawable objects as defined by DKObjectOwnerLayer. Selected objects are held in the \c -selection
 list, which is a set (there is no order to selected objects per se - though sometimes the relative Z-stacking order of objects in the selection
 is needed, and the method \c -selectedObjectsPreservingStackingOrder et. al. will provide that.

 Note that for selection, the locked state of owned objects is ignored (because it is OK to select a locked object, just not to
 do anything with it except unlock it).

 Commands directed at this layer are usually meant to to go to "the selection", either multiple or single objects.

 This class provides no direct mouse handlers for actually changing the selection - typically the selection and other manipulation
 of objects in this layer is done through the agency of tools and a DKToolController.

 The actual appearance of the selection is mainly down to the objects themselves, with some information supplied by the layer (for example
 the layer's selectionColour). Also, the layer's (or more typically the drawing's) DKKnob class is generally used by objects to display their
 selected state.

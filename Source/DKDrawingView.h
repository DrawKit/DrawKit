/** @brief DKDrawingView is the visible "front end" for the DKDrawing architecture.

 A drawing can have multiple views into the same drawing data model, each with independent scales, scroll positions and so forth, but
 all showing the same drawing. Manipulating the drawing through any view updates all of the views. In many cases there will only be
 one view. The views are not required to be in the same window.

 The actual contents of the drawing are all supplied by DKDrawing - all this does is call it to render its contents.

 If the drawing system is built by hand, the drawing owns the view controller(s), and some other object (a document for example) will own the
 drawing. However, like NSTextView, if you don't build a system by hand, this creates a default one for you which it takes ownership
 of. By default this consists of 3 layers - a grid layer, a guide layer and a standard object layer. You can change this however you like, it's
 there just as a construction convenience.

 Note that because the controllers are owned by the drawing, there is no retain cycle even when the view owns the drawing. Views are owned by
 their parent view or window, not by their controller.

 does the building. This feature means you can simply drop a drawingView into a NIB and get a

/**
A guide layer implements any number of horizontal and vertical guidelines and provides methods for snapping points and rectangles
to them.

A drawing typically has one guide layer, though you are not limited to just one - however since DKDrawing will generally provide
snapping to both guides and grid as a high-level method, having more than one guide layer can create ambiguities for the user
unless your client code takes account of the possibility of multiple guide layers.

The default snap tolerance for guides is 6 points.

By default guides don't snap to the grid. You can force a guide to snap to the grid even if this setting is off by dragging with
the shift key down.

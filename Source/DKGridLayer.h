/** @brief This class is a layer that draws a grid like a piece of graph paper.

This class is a layer that draws a grid like a piece of graph paper. In addition it can modify a point to lie at the intersection of
any of its "squares" (for snap to grid, etc).

The master interval is called the graph's span. It will be set to the actual number of coordinate units representing the main unit
of the grid. For example, a 1cm grid has a span of ~28.35.

The span is divided into an integral number of smaller divisions, for example 10 divisions of 1cm gives 1mm small squares.

A integral number of spans is called the major interval. This is drawn in a darker colour and bolder width. For example you could
highlight every 10cm by setting the spans per major to 10. The same style is also used to draw a border around the whole thing
allowing for the set margins.

Class methods exist to return a number of "standard" grids.

The spans, minor and major intervals are all drawn in different colours, but more typically you'll set a single "theme" colour which
derives the three colours such that they form a coherent set.

Grid Layers work with methods in DKDrawing to manage the rulers in an NSRulerView. Generally the rulers are set to align with the
span interval of the grid and allow for the drawing's margins. Because a ruler's settings require a name, you need to set this up along
with the grid's parameters. To help make this easy for a client application (that will probably want to present a user interface for
setting this all up), the "one stop shop" method -setSpan:unitToPointsConversionFactor:measurementSystem:drawingUnits:divisions:majors:rulerSteps:
will set up the grid AND the rulers provided the layer has already been added to a drawing. Due to limitations in NSRuler regarding its step up
and step down ratios, this method also imposes similar limits on the span divisions.

General-purpose "snap to grid" type methods are implemented by DKDrawing using the grid as a basis - the grid itself doesn't implement snapping.

Note: caching in a CGLayer is not recommended - the code is here but it doesn't draw nicely at high zooms. Turned off by default.

 method to ensure that the interior of a drawing always remains within the printable area of a
 printer (assuming margins were set by the printing parameters originally - not always the case).
 Note - from B5, this method changed to adjust all margins, not just centre the interior. The result
 is much nicer behaviour - you can set a very wide margin on one side for example and expect it to
 stay more or less where it is.

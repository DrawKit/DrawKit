/** @brief drawing layers are lightweight objects which represent a layer.

drawing layers are lightweight objects which represent a layer. They are owned by a DKDrawing which manages the
stacking order and invokes the drawRect: method as needed. The other state variables control whether the layer is
visible, locked, etc.

DKDrawing will not ever call a drawRect: on a layer that returns NO for visible.

if isOpaque returns YES, layers that are stacked below this one will not be drawn, even if they are visible. isOpaque
returns NO by default.

locked layers should not be editable, but this must be enforced by subclasses, as this class contains no editing
features. However, locked layers will never receive mouse event calls so generally this will be enough.

As layers are retained by the drawing, this does not retain the drawing.

By definition the bounds of the layer is the same as the bounds of the drawing.
 
DKLayer does not implement a dragging destination but some subclasses do. NSDraggingDestination is declared to
indicate likely handling of drag and drop operations by a layer instance.

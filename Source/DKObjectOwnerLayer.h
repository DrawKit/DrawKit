/** @brief This layer class can be the owner of any number of DKDrawableObjects.

This layer class can be the owner of any number of DKDrawableObjects. It implements the ability to contain and render
these objects.

It does NOT support the concept of a selection, or of a list of selected objects (DKObjectDrawingLayer subclasses this to
provide that functionality).

This split between the owner/renderer layer and selection allows a more fine-grained opportunity to subclass for different
application needs.

Layer caching:

When a layer is NOT active, it may boost drawing performance to cache the layer's contents offscreen. This is especially beneficial
if you are using many layers. By setting the cache option, you can control how caching is done. If set to "none", objects
are never drawn using a cache, but simply drawn in the usual way. If "pdf", the cache is an NSPDFImageRep, which stores the image
as a PDF and so draws it at full vector quality at all zoom scales. If "CGLayer", an offscreen CGLayer is used which gives the
fastest rendering but will show pixellation at higher zooms. If both pdf and CGLayer are set, both caches will be created and
the CGLayer one used when DKDrawing has its "low quality" hint set, and the PDF rep otherwise.

The cache is only used for screen drawing.
 
NOTE: PDF caching has been shown to be actually slower when there are many objects, espcially with advanced storage in use. This is
because it's an all-or-nothing rendering proposition which direct drawing of a layer's objects is not.

/** @brief This object is responsible for the visual representation of the selection as well as any content.

A drawable object is owned by a DKObjectDrawingLayer, which is responsible for drawing it when required and handling
selections. This object is responsible for the visual representation of the selection as well as any content.

It can draw whatever it likes within <bounds>, which it is responsible for calculating correctly.

hitTest can return an integer to indicate which part was hit - a value of 0 means nothing hit. The returned value's meaning
is otherwise private to the class, but is returned in the mouse event methods.

This is intended to be a semi-abstract class - it draws nothing itself. Subclasses include DKDrawableShape and DKDrawablePath -
often subclassing one of those will be more straightforward than subclassing this. A subclass must implement NSCoding and
NSCopying to be archivable, etc. There are also numerous informal protocols for geometry, snapping, hit testing, drawing and ungrouping
that need to be implemented correctly for a subclass to work fully correctly within DK.

The user info is a dictionary attached to an object. It plays no part in the graphics system, but can be used by applications
to attach arbitrary data to any drawable object.
